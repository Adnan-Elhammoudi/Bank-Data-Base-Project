Database refers to a collection of electronic records that could be processed to produce useful information. The data can be accessed, modified, managed, controlled and organized to perform various data-processing operations. The data is typically indexed across rows, columns and tables that make workload processing and data querying efficient. There are different types of databases: Object-oriented, Relational, Distributed, Hierarchical, Network and others. In enterprise applications, databases involve mission-critical, security-sensitive and compliance-focused record items that have complicated logical relationships with other datasets and grow exponentially over time as the userbase increases. As a result, these organizations require technology solutions to maintain, secure, manage and process the data stored in databases. This is where Database Management System come into play.
